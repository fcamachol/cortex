Of course. Based on the comprehensive system we've designed, there are two primary ways to create contacts: the detailed, visual way through the Web App, and the fast, conversational way through WhatsApp.

Here is your step-by-step guide.

Method 1: The Web App (The Visual & Detailed Way)
Use this method when you are at your computer and want to enter a complete, detailed profile for a new contact.

Step 1: Navigate to the Contacts Hub

Open the web application. In the main navigation panel (usually on the left), click on the "Contacts" icon. This will take you to your main contact directory.
Step 2: Initiate Contact Creation

Click the prominent [+ Add Contact] button, typically located in the top corner of the contact list panel.
Step 3: Fill Out the Contact Form

A clean, organized form or modal window will appear. It will be broken down into logical sections:

Core Identity:

Full Name: (e.g., "Esau Perez")
Relationship: A dropdown where you select Client, Family, Friend, Vendor, etc.
Company: A search box where you can link them to an existing company (e.g., "Magabar") or create a new one.
Role/Title: (e.g., "Primary Client Contact")
Contact Details:

You will see sections for Phone Numbers, Emails, and Addresses with an [+ Add] button next to each.
When you click [+ Add Phone Number], you'll provide:
The Number (e.g., "+52 55 1234 5678").
A Label (e.g., Mobile, Work, Home).
A checkbox for [‚úì] Has WhatsApp.
You can add multiple entries for each section.
Personal Context (Optional):

Aliases: Add any nicknames you use (e.g., "pingis").
Special Dates: Add their birthday or anniversary for automated reminders.
Interests: Add their hobbies or interests as tags.
Step 4: Save the Contact

Click the [Save Contact] button at the bottom. The new, detailed contact profile is now created and searchable.
Method 2: WhatsApp (The Fast & Conversational Way)
Use this method when you are on the go and need to capture a new contact's information instantly without navigating menus.

The Core Command: /add contact or /new contact

You can provide as little or as much information as you have at the moment.

Example 1: The Quick Add (Just Name and Number)

You just met someone and want to save their number quickly.
/add contact John Smith +1-555-123-4567
System Action: The app instantly creates a new contact named "John Smith" with that phone number. You can add more details later in the web app.
Example 2: Adding Context and an Alias

You want to add your daughter's details.
/add contact Isabella "pingis" +52-442-987-6543 relationship:Daughter
System Action: This is more powerful. The app:
Creates the contact "Isabella".
Adds her phone number.
Sets her relationship to "Daughter".
Crucially, it adds "pingis" as a searchable alias, so from now on, you can just type @pingis.
Example 3: Creating a Professional Contact

You want to add a new business contact.
/add contact Diana from @Magabar as "Finanzas" diana@magabar.com
System Action: The app:
Creates the contact "Diana".
Adds her email address.
Finds the existing company "Magabar".
Links Diana to Magabar with the role "Finanzas".
Recommendation:

Use WhatsApp for quick, on-the-fly capture to ensure you never lose a piece of information.
Use the Web App when you have a few minutes to flesh out a contact's profile with all the rich details that make the system so powerful.






how do we create the empresas and the groups



Show thinking
Of course. Creating Companies (Empresas) and Groups is central to organizing your network. Each serves a different purpose, and you can create them easily through both the Web App and WhatsApp.

Here is your complete guide.

Creating Companies (Empresas)
Use "Companies" to represent formal organizations. This is how you group contacts like Esau, Juan, and Diana under their shared employer, "Magabar."

Method 1: The Web App (The Recommended Way for Full Detail)
This method is best when you want to set up a company profile completely.

Navigate to the Companies Section: In the main application navigation, click on "Contacts" and then select the "Companies" tab or section.
Initiate Creation: Click the prominent [+ Add Company] button.
Fill Out the Company Profile: A form will appear asking for the organization's details:
Company Name: (e.g., "Magabar")
Website: (e.g., "www.magabar.com")
You can also add primary phone numbers or addresses for the company itself here.
Save and Add Members: After you save, you will be taken to the new "Magabar" company page. Here you will see a "Contacts at this Company" section with an [+ Add Member] button.
Clicking this allows you to search your existing contacts (like Esau, Juan, and Diana) and add them to the company.
When you add a contact, you will be prompted to define their Role (e.g., "Contador," "Finanzas").
Method 2: WhatsApp (For Quick Creation)
Use this when you need to create a company record on the fly.

Option A: Direct Command

Command: /add company Magabar website:magabar.com
System Action: This instantly creates the "Magabar" company profile with its website. You can add members later in the web app.
Option B: Implicitly While Adding a Contact (Most Common)

The system is smart enough to create companies for you automatically.

Command: /add contact Juan Perez as "Contador at @Magabar"
System Action: If the company "Magabar" does not already exist, the system will:
Create the "Magabar" company profile automatically.
Create the "Juan Perez" contact record.
Link Juan to Magabar with the role "Contador".
Creating Contact Groups
Use "Groups" for flexible, custom collections of people that aren't tied to a formal company, like a friend circle, a sports team, or a family unit.

Method 1: The Web App (The Recommended Way)
Navigate to the Groups Section: In the main application navigation, click on "Contacts" and then select the "Groups" tab.
Initiate Creation: Click the [+ Create Group] button.
Define Your Group: A simple form will appear:
Group Name: (e.g., "Sunday Soccer Team," "Book Club," "Family")
Group Description: (Optional: "Weekly pickup game at the park")
Group Icon: (Optional: You can pick an emoji like ‚öΩÔ∏è or üìö)
Save and Add Members: After saving, you are taken to the group's page. Click [+ Add Members] to search and select multiple contacts from your list to add to the group.
Method 2: WhatsApp (For Quick Creation)
Step A: Create the Group

Command: /add group "Sunday Soccer Team"
System Action: This creates an empty group with that name.
Step B: Add Members to the Group

Command: /add @Abraham @JohnSmith @David to group "Sunday Soccer Team"
System Action: The system finds those three contacts and adds them as members to the group you just created.
