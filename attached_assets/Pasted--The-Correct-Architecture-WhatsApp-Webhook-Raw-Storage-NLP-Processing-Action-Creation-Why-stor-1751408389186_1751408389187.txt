The Correct Architecture
WhatsApp Webhook → Raw Storage → NLP Processing → Action Creation
Why storage first:

Reliability: Never lose data due to processing failures
Auditing: Full trail of what users actually said
Reprocessing: Can improve NLP and reprocess historical data
Debugging: See exactly what went wrong when issues occur

The Data Flow
Step 1: Immediate storage
RawMessage {
  id: webhook_message_id
  chat_id: where it came from
  user_id: who sent it
  content: exact message text
  reaction: emoji used
  timestamp: when received
  processed: false
  context: reply_to_message, mentions, etc.
}
Step 2: Asynchronous processing

Background job picks up unprocessed messages
NLP extracts structured data
Creates appropriate records (tasks, bills, notes)
Marks message as processed

Why This Matters
Webhook reliability:

WhatsApp expects fast response (<5 seconds)
Store immediately, return 200 OK
Process complexity happens async

Data integrity:

Users expect reactions to "work immediately"
Even if NLP fails, reaction is recorded
Can fix processing errors later without losing intent

Development flexibility:

Change NLP logic without losing historical data
A/B test different processing approaches
Debug by replaying exact user inputs

The Processing Queue
Immediate response:

Webhook receives message + reaction
Store raw data instantly
Return success to WhatsApp
Queue for processing

Background processing:

NLP service processes queued items
Creates tasks/bills/notes based on extraction
Handles errors gracefully
Retries failed processing

Error Handling
Processing failures:

Message stays in queue for retry
User sees "processing..." status
Manual fallback if NLP fails completely
No lost user intent

Webhook failures:

Raw storage prevents data loss
Can replay missed webhooks
Full audit trail maintained

The Technical Implementation
Webhook endpoint:
POST /webhook
1. Validate WhatsApp signature
2. Store raw message instantly
3. Queue for processing
4. Return 200 OK (< 1 second)
Processing worker:
Background job:
1. Pick unprocessed messages
2. Run NLP extraction
3. Create domain objects
4. Mark as processed
5. Handle errors/retries
This gives you reliability, auditability, and the ability to improve your NLP over time without losing any user data or intent.
