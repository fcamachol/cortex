Project Nexus: The Complete Contacts & CRM Module
Document Purpose: To serve as the single source of truth for the design and implementation of the application's contact management and relationship intelligence system.

Part 1: Vision & Core Philosophy
The Contacts Module is the central nervous system of Project Nexus. It transcends a simple address book to become a powerful, personal CRM that understands the user's network.

Guiding Principles:

The 360-Degree Profile: The ultimate goal is to allow a user to open any contact's page and see every interaction—past, present, and future—associated with them. This includes tasks, events, financial transactions, notes, and documents.
Network Intelligence: The system must understand and map the complex web of relationships that exist between people, companies, and custom groups.
Deep Personalization: The application must learn and adapt to the user's personal context, recognizing their vocabulary (nicknames), remembering important life events (birthdays, anniversaries), and tracking personal interests.
Seamless Integration: The module is not a standalone feature. Its data must be accessible and usable from every other part of the application, especially the conversational WhatsApp interface.
Part 2: The User Experience (UX/UI) Blueprint
This section outlines the visual and interactive design for the UX/UI team.

A. Information Architecture
The Contacts module is a global, top-level feature. Its entities are not confined to a single Space.

/app/contacts: The main directory for all individual contacts.
/app/contact/{id}: The detailed 360-degree profile view for a single person.
/app/companies: The main directory for all organizations.
/app/company/{id}: The detailed profile view for a single company.
/app/groups: The main directory for all user-defined contact groups.
/app/group/{id}: The detailed management page for a single group.
B. Screen & Component Design
1. The Main Directory Views (Contacts, Companies, Groups)
Layout: A clean, modern layout with a powerful search and filtering bar at the top.
Search: A single search input that intelligently searches across names, aliases/nicknames, and company names.
Filtering: Prominent buttons or dropdowns to filter the list (e.g., by Relationship type like "Family" or "Client," or by Company).
View Toggle: Buttons to switch between a dense List View (for efficiency) and a more visual Grid View (with avatars/logos).
Primary Action: A clearly visible [+ Add] button to create a new contact, company, or group.
2. The Contact Detail Page (The 360-Degree Profile)
This is the most critical screen. It should be designed as a clean, scannable dashboard.

Header Section:
Large, prominent avatar/profile picture.
Full Name in a large, bold font.
Primary Role & Company directly below (e.g., "Contador at Magabar"). The company name is a link to its own detail page.
Core Details Section: A well-organized block showing:
Phone Numbers: A list, each with a Label (Work, Mobile), a small WhatsApp icon if applicable, and a (primary) tag.
Emails & Addresses: Similar lists with labels and primary tags.
Personal Context Section:
Aliases/Nicknames: Displayed as stylish, removable pills/tags (e.g., [pingis]).
Special Dates: A list of important dates (e.g., "Birthday: August 15"). The system uses these to generate automated reminder tasks.
Interests: A collection of tag-like pills for hobbies and preferences.
Relationships Section: This section visually maps the contact's network.
Works at: Displays a link to the company profile.
Member of Groups: Lists all groups the contact belongs to (e.g., "Book Club," "Sunday Soccer Team").
Related Contacts: The "family tree" view, showing direct interpersonal links (e.g., "Spouse: [Pau]", "Children: [Leo], [Mia]"). Each name is a link to that contact's profile.
Activity Tabs: A powerful set of tabs that pulls in data from across the entire application.
Tasks: A real-time list of all tasks where this contact is the Stakeholder or the Assignee.
Events: A chronological list of all calendar events they are a participant in.
Finance: A complete history of all Transactions, Bills, and Loans linked to them.
Notes & Docs: A feed of all notes and documents where they are mentioned or attached.
3. The Company & Group Detail Pages
These are simpler dashboard pages focused on listing members.

Header: Displays the company logo or group icon and its name.
Primary View: A clean list of all associated Contacts. For companies, each contact's Role (e.g., "Contador") is displayed next to their name.
