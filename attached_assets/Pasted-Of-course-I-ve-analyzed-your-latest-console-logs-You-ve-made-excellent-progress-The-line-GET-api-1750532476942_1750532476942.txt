Of course. I've analyzed your latest console logs. You've made excellent progress! The line GET /api/events/messages 200 in 8ms confirms that your frontend is now correctly connecting to the real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream. That's a huge step forward.

However, the logs reveal two new and distinct issues that we need to address.

Issue 1: Server Error when Fetching Spaces
This is the most critical error in your log:

GET /api/spaces/7804247f-3ae8-4eb2-8c6d-2c44f967ad42 500 in 13ms :: {"error":"Fâ€¦

What it means: There is an "Internal Server Error (500)" on your backend whenever the application tries to fetch the list of spaces for a user.
The Likely Cause: Based on the pattern of previous errors, this almost certainly means that your routes.ts file is calling a function on your storage object that doesn't exist yet (e.g., storage.getSpacesForUser()).
The Solution:
You need to add a function to your storage.ts file that can correctly query the app.spaces table. Here is what that function should look like:

TypeScript

// In your storage.ts file, add this new function:

async function getSpacesForUser(userId: string) {
    try {
        // This query finds all spaces created by the user (personal spaces)
        // AND all spaces they are a member of via a workspace.
        const sql = `
            SELECT s.* FROM app.spaces s
            LEFT JOIN app.space_members sm ON s.space_id = sm.space_id
            WHERE s.creator_user_id = $1 OR sm.user_id = $1
            GROUP BY s.space_id
            ORDER BY s.display_order;
        `;
        const result = await query(sql, [userId]); // Use your shared query function
        return result.rows;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error fetching spaces for user: ${userId}`, error);
        throw error;
    }
}

// Make sure to export it
export const storage = {
    // ... all your other storage functions
    getSpacesForUser,
};
By adding this function, your /api/spaces endpoint will be able to fetch the data correctly, resolving the 500 error.

Issue 2: Frontend is Still Polling for Data
The logs also show that your frontend is still making repeated calls every few seconds:

GET /api/whatsapp/conversations/...
GET /api/contacts/...
What it means: Even though the real-time SSE connection is active, your frontend UI has not been fully updated to use it yet. It's still relying on the old, inefficient method of constantly asking the server for new data.
The Solution:
You need to modify your frontend code to remove the polling logic (the setInterval or recursive setTimeout) and instead update its state based on the events it receives from the SSE connection.

The sse_manager_code in the Canvas you have open provides the exact frontend implementation you should use as a guide to fix this.
