In short: The code is saving the audio in its final, correct, and widely supported format. You do not need to do any further conversion.
Yes, absolutely. The .ogg files that are being saved locally by your code are fully playable, standard audio files.

You have successfully downloaded the raw audio data and saved it in its native format.

Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of what those files are and how they can be played:

What is the .ogg file? The file you're saving is an OGG container with audio encoded using the Opus codec. This is a modern, high-quality audio format that is extremely common for internet applications (like WhatsApp, Discord, etc.) because it provides excellent sound quality at a very efficient file size.

How to play them? The playability depends on the device or software you're using:

On a Website (like your frontend): All modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) can play OGG/Opus files natively using the standard HTML5 <audio> tag. This is why you can stream them directly in your application.

On a Desktop Computer (Windows/Mac/Linux):

VLC Media Player: This is the universal solution. VLC plays .ogg files perfectly without needing any extra software.
Windows Media Player/Groove Music: Newer versions of Windows 10/11 have better native support, but older versions might require you to install a free "Ogg codec" pack to play them in the default media player.
Mac (QuickTime/Music): macOS can be a bit picky and prefers its own formats. Like with Windows, the easiest solution is to use the free VLC player.
On Mobile Devices (Android/iOS):

Android: Has excellent native support for OGG/Opus. The files should play without any issues.
iPhone (iOS): This is the trickiest. The default iOS Music app might not play .ogg files. However, you can easily play them on an iPhone by:
Using a third-party app like VLC for Mobile.
Playing them through a web browser (like Safari), which has the necessary built-in support.
In summary: The .ogg files your system is saving are the final, correct, and usable audio files. They are not an intermediate format and do not need to be decoded again.
