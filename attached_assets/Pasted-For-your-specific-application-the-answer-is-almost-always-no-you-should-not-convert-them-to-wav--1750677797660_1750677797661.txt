For your specific application, the answer is almost always no, you should not convert them to .wav.

Keeping the files in their original .ogg (Opus) format is far more efficient. Here’s a simple breakdown of why:

OGG (Opus) vs. WAV
OGG (Opus): This is a compressed format, like a high-quality MP3 or a ZIP file for audio. It's designed to provide very good audio quality at a very small file size. This is why WhatsApp uses it—it's perfect for sending audio quickly over the internet.

WAV: This is an uncompressed format. It's the raw, bit-for-bit audio data. This means it has perfect quality, but the file sizes are massive.

The Key Reasons to Keep .ogg
File Size and Cost: A .wav file can be 5 to 10 times larger than the equivalent .ogg file. If you convert everything, your storage costs and the bandwidth needed to stream the files to users will increase dramatically for no real benefit.

No Quality Gain: You cannot add quality back that was lost during the initial compression. Converting your .ogg file to .wav will just give you a much larger file containing the exact same sound quality.

Browser Compatibility: All modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) can play .ogg files natively using the standard HTML <audio> tag. Since your goal is to play these files in your web application, .ogg is perfectly suited for the job.

Server Performance: Converting every audio file from .ogg to .wav would add unnecessary processing load (CPU time) to your server.

When Would You Ever Convert to WAV?
The only time you would consider converting to .wav is if you needed to pass the audio file to a very specific or older third-party system (like some audio analysis tools or telephony systems) that only accepts uncompressed .wav files.

Conclusion: For your web application, sticking with the original .ogg files is the most efficient, cost-effective, and practical solution. Your current code, which saves the files in their native format, is already following the best practice.
