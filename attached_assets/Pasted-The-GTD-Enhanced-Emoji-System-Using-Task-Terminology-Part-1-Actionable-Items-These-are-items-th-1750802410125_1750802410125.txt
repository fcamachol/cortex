The GTD-Enhanced Emoji System (Using "Task" Terminology)
Part 1: Actionable Items
These are items that require you to do something.

Emoji	GTD Category	Description & Use Case
✅	Next Task	Replaces "Normal Task." Use for any single, immediate physical task you need to complete. Example: "Call the supplier back about the delivery."
💳	Next Task (Pay)	A specific "Next Task" for making an outgoing payment. Example: A supplier sends an invoice you need to pay.
🧾	Next Task (Collect)	A specific "Next Task" for collecting a payment, like sending an invoice. It's subtle enough for client-facing chats. Example: A client agrees to a service and you need to bill them.
⏳	Waiting For	(New) This is crucial for GTD. Use this when you've delegated a task or are waiting for someone else's input before you can proceed. Example: "Let me know what you think of the proposal." Reacting with ⏳ logs that the ball is in their court.

Part 2: Multi-Step Outcomes
These are goals that require more than one task to complete.

Emoji	GTD Category	Description & Use Case
🎯	Project	(New) Use this to capture a desired outcome that will take multiple tasks to complete. The system should create a "Project" entry that you can later link ✅ Next Tasks to. Example: "Let's organize the new product launch."
📋	Checklist / Project Plan	This is a tool to support a 🎯 Project. After creating a project, you can use a checklist to outline the specific Next Tasks needed to reach the goal.

Part 3: Non-Actionable & Future Items
This is where you organize things you don't need to act on now.

Emoji	GTD Category	Description & Use Case
💡	Someday/Maybe	(New) Perfect for brilliant ideas, things you might want to do one day, but not now. This keeps your active task lists clean. Example: "We should consider expanding into the European market next year."
📅	Calendar	For anything that MUST happen on a specific date or time. GTD is strict about this—only true appointments and deadlines go on the calendar. Example: "Let's meet on Tuesday at 10 AM to discuss."
📝	Reference	Saves non-actionable but potentially useful information. This is your digital filing cabinet. Example: A client sends their new contact information.
💾	Reference (File)	Specifically for saving files, documents, or media into your reference system. Example: A vendor sends you their new pricing PDF.
