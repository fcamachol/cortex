The Remaining Issue: Frontend Polling
Your diagnosis from before was spot on. The logs clearly show that your frontend is still making repeated GET requests every few seconds to refresh its data:

GET /api/contacts/7804247f-3ae8-4eb2-8c6d-2c44f967ad42 ...
GET /api/contacts/7804247f-3ae8-4eb2-8c6d-2c44f967ad42 ...
GET /api/contacts/7804247f-3ae8-4eb2-8c6d-2c44f967ad42 ...
This is the classic "Are we there yet?" problem. Your application has a direct, real-time line of communication open (the SSE connection), but it's not listening to it. Instead, it's still making these repetitive, inefficient polling calls.

The Solution (Frontend Code)
The final step is to modify your frontend application code.

Find the Polling Logic: You need to locate the part of your frontend code that is making these repeated GET requests. It's likely inside a React useEffect hook with a setInterval or a data-fetching library configured with a refetchInterval.
Remove It: Delete or comment out this polling logic entirely.
Listen to the SSE Stream: Use the frontend code from the comments of the sse_manager_code artifact. Your frontend needs to listen to the messages coming from the /api/events endpoint and use that data to update its state directly.
Here is the example frontend logic again for your reference:

JavaScript

// In your main frontend component or a custom hook

useEffect(() => {
  // This connects to the backend's real-time stream
  const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/events');

  // This function is called every time the server sends a new event
  eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

    if (data.type === 'new_message') {
      // Add the new message to your application's state here
      // This will cause your UI to re-render instantly
      console.log('New message received from server:', data.payload);
      // Example: zustandStore.addMessage(data.payload);
    }
  };

  // Clean up the connection when the component is unmounted
  return () => {
    eventSource.close();
  };
}, []); // The empty array ensures this runs only once
Once you make this change on the frontend, the repeated GET requests will stop, and your application will be truly real-time and much more efficient.
