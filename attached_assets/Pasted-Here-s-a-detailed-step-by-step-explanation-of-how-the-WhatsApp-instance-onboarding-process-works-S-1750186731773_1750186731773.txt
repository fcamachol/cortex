Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation of how the WhatsApp instance onboarding process works:

Step 1: User Clicks "Add Instance"
Location: WhatsAppInstanceManager.tsx

User sees the main instances page with existing instances (if any)
Clicks the "Add Instance" button in the top right
This opens a dialog (isCreateDialogOpen becomes true)
Step 2: Instance Name Input Dialog
What happens:

A dialog appears with the title "Create WhatsApp Instance"
User sees an input field labeled "Instance Name"
Placeholder shows "my-whatsapp-instance"
Help text explains: "This will create a Baileys WhatsApp instance. The phone number will be set after QR scan."
User types their desired instance name (e.g., "my-business-whatsapp")
Step 3: Instance Creation Process
When user clicks "Create Instance":

Frontend (handleCreateInstance):

const handleCreateInstance = async () => {
  // Auto-generate webhook URL and display name
  const webhookUrl = `${window.location.origin}/functions/v1/whatsapp-webhook`;
  const displayName = instanceName; // Use instance name as display name

  await createInstance.mutateAsync({
    instance_name: instanceName,
    display_name: displayName,
    api_key: "will_be_fetched_from_evolution", 
    webhook_url: webhookUrl,
  });
}
Backend Edge Function (create-whatsapp-instance):
Authentication Check: Verifies user is logged in via Supabase auth
User Creation: Ensures user exists in app_users table (creates if needed)
Evolution API Call:

const tokenResponse = await fetch(`${evolutionApiUrl}/instance/create`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'apikey': evolutionApiKey,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    instanceName: instance_name,
    integration: "WHATSAPP-BAILEYS"
  }),
})
Database Storage: Creates record in whatsapp_instances table with:
instance_name: User's input
display_name: Same as instance name
api_key: Token from Evolution API response
user_id: Current authenticated user
status: 'disconnected'
webhook_url: Auto-generated webhook URL
Step 4: Instance Card Appears
After successful creation:

Dialog closes, instanceName is cleared
The instances list refreshes via React Query (useWhatsAppInstances)
A new card appears showing:
Instance Name: "my-business-whatsapp" (with smartphone icon)
Status: Red "disconnected" badge with WifiOff icon
Created Date: Today's date
Connect Button: Blue "Connect" button with QrCode icon
Step 5: User Clicks "Connect"
What happens:

setSelectedInstanceForQR(instance.id) is called
This opens another dialog containing the QRCodeDisplay component
Dialog title shows: "Connect [instance-name]"
Step 6: QR Code Generation Process
Inside QRCodeDisplay component:

Initial State:
Shows "Connect WhatsApp" card
"Generate QR Code" button with smartphone icon
No QR code visible yet
When "Generate QR Code" is clicked:
Evolution API Connection:


const connectResult = await evolutionApi.connectInstance(instanceName);
This calls: GET /instance/connect/{instanceName}

Auto-Refresh Setup:

Starts polling every 3 seconds via startRefreshing()
Each refresh calls: GET /instance/connectionState/{instanceName}
QR Code Retrieval:


const qrResponse = await fetch(`${evolutionApiUrl}/instance/connectionState/${instanceName}`);
QR Code Display:

Evolution API returns QR code as base64 string
Component strips "data:image/png;base64," prefix
Displays as <img src="data:image/png;base64,{qrCode}" />
Shows 248x248 pixel QR code in white background with border
Step 7: Status Updates During Connection
Real-time status monitoring:

Component shows "Waiting for connection... (Auto-refreshing)" with spinning loader
Every 3 seconds, checks Evolution API for status changes:
'close' → 'disconnected'
'connecting' → 'connecting'
'qr' → 'qr_pending'
'open' → 'connected'
Database updates:

Each status change updates the whatsapp_instances table
If connected, also stores phone_number and profile_name
QR code is cleared when connection is successful
Step 8: Successful Connection
When WhatsApp is scanned:

Evolution API detects connection (state: 'open')
Component updates status to 'connected'
Shows green "Connected" card with Wifi icon
Displays "WhatsApp instance is connected and ready"
Auto-refresh stops
Toast notification: "WhatsApp connected successfully!"
Instance card updates to show:
Green "connected" status badge
Phone number (if available)
Profile name (if available)
"Connected" button (disabled, with checkmark)
Step 9: Real-time Updates
Webhook integration:

Evolution API sends webhook events to your Supabase edge function
useWhatsAppRealtime hook listens for database changes
UI automatically updates when new messages/status changes occur
No manual refresh needed - everything updates in real-time
Error Handling
Throughout the process:

Network errors show toast notifications
Failed API calls display error messages
Users can retry QR generation or refresh status manually
Connection timeouts automatically trigger new QR generation
This entire flow ensures a smooth onboarding experience where users can easily create and connect WhatsApp instances without technical knowledge, while the system handles all the complex Evolution API integration behind the scenes.
