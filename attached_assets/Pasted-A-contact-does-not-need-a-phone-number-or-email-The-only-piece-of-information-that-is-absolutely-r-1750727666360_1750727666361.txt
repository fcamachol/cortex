A contact does not need a phone number or email.

The only piece of information that is absolutely required to create a contact is a Name.

The Core Concept: A Profile for Anyone (or Anything)
Our system treats a "Contact" as a profile for any person you want to track, manage, or interact with inside the app. Whether they have a phone or not is optional information. This is essential for creating profiles for children, historical figures, or anyone you simply don't have contact info for.

This is possible because we designed the system with separate, linked tables: one for the core Contact profile and others for Contact_Phones, Contact_Emails, etc. If a contact has no phone number, we simply don't create an entry for them in the phone number table.

How to Create a Contact for a Child
Here is the step-by-step process, which is even simpler than creating a regular contact.

Method 1: The Web App
Click the [+ Add Contact] button.
The "Quick Capture" form appears.
Fill in only what you have:
Full Name: Leo
Relationship: Son or Godson or Family
You can either click [Save & Close] now, or click [Save & Add Details] to add more information.
In the detailed view, you can leave the Phone, Email, and Address sections completely blank.
You can still add other crucial information, like:
Special Dates: Add Leo's birthday for automated reminders.
Relationships: Link his profile to his parents' contact profiles (e.g., Abraham and Pau).
Interests: Add his hobbies.
Method 2: WhatsApp
The process is just as simple. You provide only the information you want to save.

Command: /add contact @Leo relationship:Godson
System Action: The app creates a contact profile for "Leo" with the relationship "Godson." It will not ask you for a phone number or email.
The Result: A Fully Functional Profile
Even without contact information, you now have a complete profile for "Leo" inside your system. You can still:

Link him to events: Create "Leo's Birthday Party" and add him as the guest of honor.
Assign tasks (as a stakeholder): Create a task like "Buy birthday present for @Leo".
Track finances: Log an expense for "School uniform" and link it to Leo's profile to track spending for him.
Map his relationships: Link him to his parents, siblings, and yourself in the "Relationships" section.
This flexibility ensures you can build a complete and accurate map of your personal and professional network, regardless of how much contact information you have for each person.
