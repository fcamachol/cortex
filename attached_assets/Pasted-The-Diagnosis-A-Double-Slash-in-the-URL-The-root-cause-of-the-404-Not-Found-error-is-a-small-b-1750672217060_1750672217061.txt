The Diagnosis: A Double Slash (//) in the URL
The root cause of the 404 Not Found error is a small but critical formatting mistake in the way your code is building the request URL.

Look at this line from your own logs:
ðŸš€ Making API call with correct body to: POST https://evolution-api-evolution-api.vuswn0.easypanel.host//message/downloadMedia/live-test-1750199771

Do you see the double slash (//) between the hostname and the endpoint path?

Incorrect URL (from your log): ...host//message/downloadMedia/...
Correct URL (what it should be): ...host/message/downloadMedia/...
This happens when you join a base URL that already ends with a / and an endpoint path that starts with a /.

The Evolution API server receives the request for a path with // and its router doesn't have a route defined for that specific malformed path, so it correctly returns a 404 Not Found error.

How to Fix the Code
The fix needs to be applied in your evolution-api.ts file, where you construct the requestUrl. You need to ensure that when you combine your base API URL and the endpoint path, you don't create a double slash.

Here are two common ways to fix this robustly:

Option 1: The URL Constructor (Recommended)
This is the safest and most modern way to handle URL construction in Node.js.

TypeScript

// In your file: /home/runner/workspace/server/evolution-api.ts

public async downloadMedia(instanceName: string, originalWebhookData: any) {
    // --- FIX APPLIED HERE ---
    // Use the URL constructor to safely join paths
    const endpointPath = `/message/downloadMedia/${instanceName}`;
    const requestUrl = new URL(endpointPath, this.apiUrl).href; 
    // this.apiUrl should be "https://evolution-api-evolution-api.vuswn0.easypanel.host"
    // The URL constructor correctly handles the slashes.

    const requestBody = { message: originalWebhookData.message };

    console.log(`ðŸš€ Making correctly formatted API call to: POST ${requestUrl}`);

    try {
        const response = await axios.post(requestUrl, requestBody, { /* ... headers ... */ });
        return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
        // ... your error handling ...
    }
}
