# Cortex Personal Second Brain - Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the phased migration approach to implement the new Cortex Personal Second Brain system alongside the existing WhatsApp CRM platform without disrupting current functionality.

## Migration Philosophy

**Non-Destructive Approach**: The migration follows a careful phased approach that:
- Never modifies or deletes existing tables
- Creates new schemas alongside current ones
- Maintains full backwards compatibility
- Allows gradual transition at your own pace
- Provides rollback capabilities at each phase

## Phase 1: Schema Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### What's Been Created

1. **New Cortex Schema** (`cortex`)
   - Completely separate from existing schemas
   - Universal entity system with prefixed UUIDs
   - Google Drive-like spaces system
   - Universal linking architecture

2. **Core Entity Types**
   - `cp_`: Persons (contacts, people)
   - `cc_`: Companies (businesses, organizations)
   - `cg_`: Groups (teams, families, categories)
   - `co_`: Objects (physical items, assets)
   - `ca_`: Financial Accounts (bank accounts, cards)
   - `cv_`: Vendors (suppliers, service providers)
   - `cj_`: Projects (work projects, personal goals)
   - `ce_`: Events (meetings, appointments)
   - `cs_`: Spaces (folders, workspaces)

3. **Content Entity Tables**
   - `cortex.tasks`: Enhanced task management
   - `cortex.notes`: Full-text searchable notes
   - `cortex.documents`: Version-controlled files
   - `cortex.bills`: Financial bill management

4. **Universal Linking System**
   - `cortex.entity_relationships`: Entity-to-entity links
   - `cortex.entity_links`: Content-to-entity links
   - `cortex.space_items`: Space content organization

5. **Google Drive-like Features**
   - `cortex.spaces`: Hierarchical folder structure
   - `cortex.space_members`: Permission management
   - `cortex.space_share_links`: Public/private sharing
   - `cortex.space_activity`: Activity logging

### Files Created
- `shared/cortex-schema.ts`: Complete schema definition
- `server/cortex-migration.ts`: Migration utilities
- `run-cortex-migration.js`: Migration execution script

### Running Phase 1
```bash
# Create the cortex schema
node run-cortex-migration.js

# Create with sample data for testing
node run-cortex-migration.js --samples
```

## Phase 2: Bridge Tables & Data Mapping

### Objectives
- Create bridge tables to map existing data to Cortex entities
- Establish data synchronization mechanisms
- Build migration utilities for selective data transfer

### Planned Implementation
1. **Bridge Tables**
   - `cortex.legacy_contact_mapping`: Map CRM contacts to cp_ entities
   - `cortex.legacy_company_mapping`: Map CRM companies to cc_ entities
   - `cortex.legacy_project_mapping`: Map CRM projects to cj_ entities
   - `cortex.legacy_task_mapping`: Map CRM tasks to Cortex tasks

2. **Data Sync Service**
   - Bidirectional synchronization
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Change tracking and auditing

3. **Migration Tools**
   - Selective data migration utilities
   - Validation and integrity checks
   - Rollback capabilities

## Phase 3: API Layer Development

### Objectives
- Create Cortex API endpoints
- Implement universal entity operations
- Build space management APIs

### Planned Implementation
1. **Entity Management APIs**
   - Universal entity CRUD operations
   - Relationship management
   - Search and filtering

2. **Space Management APIs**
   - Hierarchical space operations
   - Permission management
   - Sharing and collaboration

3. **Content APIs**
   - Task management with entity linking
   - Note creation with full-text search
   - Document management with versioning

## Phase 4: Frontend Integration

### Objectives
- Create Cortex-compatible UI components
- Implement universal entity picker
- Build space navigation interface

### Planned Implementation
1. **Universal Components**
   - EntityPicker: Universal entity selection
   - EntityCard: Display any entity type
   - RelationshipManager: Visual relationship editing

2. **Space Interface**
   - SpaceNavigator: Hierarchical folder navigation
   - SpacePermissions: Permission management UI
   - SpaceActivity: Activity feed and collaboration

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Gradual replacement of legacy components
   - Dual-mode operation (legacy + Cortex)
   - User preference settings

## Phase 5: Data Migration & Transition

### Objectives
- Migrate existing data to Cortex format
- Maintain data integrity during transition
- Provide user controls for migration pace

### Planned Implementation
1. **Migration Dashboard**
   - Progress tracking
   - Data validation reports
   - Migration controls

2. **Selective Migration**
   - Choose what to migrate
   - Preview migration results
   - Granular control over process

3. **Validation & Testing**
   - Data integrity checks
   - Performance benchmarking
   - User acceptance testing

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Risk Mitigation
- No disruption to current operations
- Full rollback capabilities at each phase
- Incremental testing and validation

### 2. Flexibility
- Choose your own migration pace
- Selective feature adoption
- Maintain current workflows during transition

### 3. Enhanced Capabilities
- Universal entity linking system
- Google Drive-like organization
- Advanced relationship management
- Full-text search and tagging

### 4. Future-Proof Architecture
- Scalable entity system
- Flexible content organization
- Extensible relationship types
- Modern database design patterns

## Technical Advantages

### 1. Schema Design
- Optimized for performance and scalability
- Universal entity system with type safety
- Flexible metadata and tagging
- Audit trails and activity logging

### 2. Data Organization
- Hierarchical spaces like Google Drive
- Universal linking between any entities
- Advanced permission management
- Version control for documents

### 3. Integration Capabilities
- RESTful API design
- Real-time synchronization
- Webhook support
- External system integration

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete**: Cortex schema created and ready
üîÑ **Phase 2 Next**: Bridge tables and data mapping
‚è≥ **Phase 3**: API layer development
‚è≥ **Phase 4**: Frontend integration
‚è≥ **Phase 5**: Data migration and transition

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Schema**
   ```bash
   # Examine the Cortex schema
   cat shared/cortex-schema.ts
   ```

2. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   # Create the schema
   node run-cortex-migration.js --samples
   ```

3. **Explore Tables**
   - Check the new `cortex` schema in your database
   - Review the entity types and relationship capabilities
   - Test with sample data

4. **Plan Your Transition**
   - Decide which features to adopt first
   - Plan your data migration strategy
   - Set timeline for each phase

## Support and Questions

This migration is designed to be completely safe and reversible. Each phase can be implemented independently, and you maintain full control over the transition process.

The new Cortex system will coexist with your current WhatsApp CRM, gradually replacing components as you're ready to transition.
